            <p>
                Hi ! I'm Md Robiul Islam. I am Full Stack Web Developer, Problem Solver and Programmer. I have about three years of working experience on this field. If I discribe myself in one sentence then it will be "I am a speed learner." I love to learn new things.
                I started my coding journey since I was in high school. Coding is like a passion for me. I love to code all day long, while my code works then I feel proud of me.    
                My vision is to teach programming to all people free of cost and make the world a better place. And I will prove that money is not a problem to learn.

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
